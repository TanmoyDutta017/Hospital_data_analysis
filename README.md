![Dashboard](https://github.com/TanmoyDutta017/Hospital_data_analysis/blob/main/files/Hospital%20Data.png)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project showcases an interactive Hospital Emergency Room dashboard
built using Microsoft Excel to analyze patient flow, operational
efficiency, and service quality.

Raw hospital data stored in CSV files is transformed into a structured
data model and visualized through an insight-driven dashboard that
supports healthcare decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives

-   Monitor emergency room patient volume and admission patterns
-   Evaluate operational efficiency using wait time and timeliness
    metrics
-   Assess patient satisfaction and service quality trends
-   Analyze demographic distribution across age and gender
-   Identify department referral patterns for resource planning

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

-   Excel Power Query → Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation
-   Calendar Table (Power Query) → Enables time intelligence analysis
-   Power Pivot Data Model → Relationship modeling and scalable analysis
-   Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts → Interactive visual analytics
-   Slicers & Filters → Month and year level drill-down

## 📊 Key KPIs

-   Number of Patients (daily trend tracking)
-   Average Wait Time (operational efficiency monitoring)
-   Patient Satisfaction Score (service quality evaluation)

## 📈 Dashboard Analysis

-   Admission status comparison (admitted vs not admitted)
-   Timeliness analysis for patients seen within target time
-   Gender distribution of ER patients
-   Patient age group segmentation
-   Department referral analysis to identify care pathways

## ⭐ Features

-   Interactive monthly and yearly filtering
-   Automated data refresh using Power Query
-   Data model--driven dashboard architecture
-   KPI cards with trend visualization (sparklines)
-   Multi-dimensional analysis across demographics and referrals

## 💡 Learning Outcomes

-   Built an end-to-end Excel data analytics solution using Power Query
    and Power Pivot
-   Implemented time intelligence through a custom calendar table
-   Designed KPI-driven healthcare dashboards
-   Improved data storytelling and visualization skills
